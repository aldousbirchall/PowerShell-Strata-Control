# PowerShell-Strata-Control
Poweshell Scripts as Data / Analytics middleware

Some proof of concept scripts using PowerShell - basically piping data around. Why....

Part of a project to build / protoype a complete open source front office risk system using: 
Open Gamma Strata (derivatives analytics), 
Python (Data, non-derivates analytics), 
MS SQL Server Express (database. Could use MySQL / PostgreSQL (truly open source) but for non-massive financial data sets in .NET framework, this is easier and more robust - at least on the scale of me building the whole thing myself).
Excel (essentially a GUI. Could go down the JavaScript / HTML route, but traders like to cut and past from excel). 
Powershell (just trying this out, but seems to be very powerful and forgiving to new users). Backwards compatible with CMD shell.
